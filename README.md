# Grad-Project---predictive-maintenance
The project aims to bridge the gap between traditional PLC-controlled factories and modern IoT technologies by integrating data telemetry units, developing a machine learning model for predictive maintenance, and creating a real-time data visualization dashboard. This will enhance factory efficiency and enable smarter manufacturing processes.
